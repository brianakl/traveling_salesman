This program will input a distance matrix and uses the boost graph library
to implement various algorithms to find solutions to the tsp 
These algorithms include:
- Brute Force
- Nearest Neighbor
- Genetic Algorithm
- Christofides

To run you must have Boost Graph Library installed.

After intstalling you should run:

```
make main
./main
```
Now you can type in your input file and choose an algorithm to solve TSP. For example:

```
p01_d.txt
```
Then enter the input file type, in this case 1 = coordinates. Then select the algorithm to run.
